# Smart-System-for-Academic-Mental-Health-Monitoring
This project aims to predict whether a student is experiencing depression or not using Machine Learning techniques. The system analyzes multiple academic, social, and lifestyle factors — such as GPA, study/work hours, sleep quality, family support, and stress levels — to identify early signs of depression among students.
